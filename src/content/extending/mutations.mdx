## About Mutations

Mutations in GraphQL signify that some data is changing. Other than the keyword mutation, they are _technically_ identical to Queries.

## Register new Mutation

`@todo: Document how to do this`

## Extend existing mutations

Extending mutation for post

```
		/**
		 * Run an action after the additional data has been updated. This is a great spot to hook into to
		 * update additional data related to postObjects, such as setting relationships, updating additional postmeta,
		 * or sending emails to Kevin. . .whatever you need to do with the postObject.
		 *
		 * @param int $post_id The ID of the postObject being mutated
		 * @param array $input The input for the mutation
		 * @param \WP_Post_Type $post_type_object The Post Type Object for the type of post being mutated
		 * @param string $mutation_name The name of the mutation (ex: create, update, delete)
		 * @param AppContext $context The AppContext passed down to all resolvers
		 * @param ResolveInfo $info The ResolveInfo passed down to all resolvers
		 * @param string $intended_post_status The intended post_status the post should have according to the mutation input
		 * @param string $default_post_status The default status posts should use if an intended status wasn't set
		 */

		add_action( 'graphql_post_object_mutation_update_additional_data', 'graphql_register_edit_mutation', 10, 5 );

		function graphql_register_edit_mutation( $post_id, $input, $mutation_name, $context, $info ) {
			// Consider other sanitization if necessary and validation such as which
			// user role/capability should be able to insert this value, etc.
			if ( ! empty( $input['example'] ) ) {
				update_post_meta( $post_id, 'example', $input['example'] );
			}
		}
```
Extending mutation for user

```
		/**
		 * Run an action after the additional data has been updated. This is a great spot to hook into to
		 * update additional data related to users, such as setting relationships, updating additional usermeta,
		 * or sending emails to Kevin... whatever you need to do with the userObject.
		 *
		 * @param int $user_id The ID of the user being mutated
		 * @param array $input The input for the mutation
		 * @param string $mutation_name The name of the mutation (ex: create, update, delete)
		 * @param AppContext $context The AppContext passed down the resolve tree
		 * @param ResolveInfo $info The ResolveInfo passed down the Resolve Tree
		 */

		add_action( 'graphql_user_object_mutation_update_additional_data', 'graphql_register_user_mutation', 10, 5 );

		function graphql_register_user_mutation( $user_id, $input, $mutation_name, $context, $info ) {
			if ( isset( $input['hobbies'] ) ) {
				// Consider other sanitization if necessary and validation such as which
				// user role/capability should be able to insert this value, etc.
				update_user_meta( $user_id, 'hobbies', $input['hobbies'] );
			}
		}
