If the element that corresponds to the attributeName is an array of strings, it will return a nested array of objects.\n\t * @example\n\t * import React from 'react';\n\t * import { connectHighlight } from 'react-instantsearch/connectors';\n\t * import { InstantSearch, Hits } from 'react-instantsearch/dom';\n\t *\n\t * const CustomHighlight = connectHighlight(\n\t *   ({ highlight, attributeName, hit, highlightProperty }) => {\n\t *     const parsedHit = highlight({ attributeName, hit, highlightProperty: '_highlightResult' });\n\t *     const highlightedHits = parsedHit.map(part => {\n\t *       if (part.isHighlighted) return <mark>{part.value}</mark>;\n\t *       return part.value;\n\t *     });\n\t *     return <div>{highlightedHits}</div>;\n\t *   }\n\t * );\n\t *\n\t * const Hit = ({hit}) =>\n\t * <p>\n\t *   <CustomHighlight attributeName=\"description\" hit={hit} />\n\t * </p>;\n\t *\n\t * export default function App() {\n\t *   return (\n\t *     <InstantSearch\n\t *        appId=\"latency\"\n\t *        apiKey=\"6be0576ff61c053d5f9a3225e2a90f76\"\n\t *        indexName=\"ikea\">\n\t *       <Hits hitComponent={Hit} />\n\t *     </InstantSearch>\n\t *   );\n\t * }\n\t */\n\texports.default = (0, _createConnector2.default)({\n\t  displayName: 'AlgoliaHighlighter',\n\t\n\t  propTypes: {},\n\t\n\t  getProvidedProps: function getProvidedProps() {\n\t    return { highlight: highlight };\n\t  }\n\t});\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 336 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\t  value: true\n\t});\n\t\n\tvar _orderBy2 = __webpack_require__(293);\n\t\n\tvar _orderBy3 = _interopRequireDefault(_orderBy2);\n\t\n\tvar _propTypes = __webpack_require__(1);\n\t\n\tvar _propTypes2 = _interopRequireDefault(_propTypes);\n\t\n\tvar _createConnector = __webpack_require__(22);\n\t\n\tvar _createConnector2 = _interopRequireDefault(_createConnector);\n\t\n\tvar _indexUtils = __webpack_require__(24);\n\t\n\tfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }\n\t\n\tfunction _defineProperty(obj, key, value) { if (key in obj) { Object.defineProperty(obj, key, { value: value, enumerable: true, configurable: true, writable: true }); } else { obj[key] = value; } return obj; }\n\t\n\tvar namespace = 'menu';\n\t\n\tfunction getId(props) {\n\t  return props.attributeName;\n\t}\n\t\n\tfunction getCurrentRefinement(props, searchState, context) {\n\t  return (0, _indexUtils.getCurrentRefinementValue)(props, searchState, context, namespace + '.' + getId(props), null, function (currentRefinement) {\n\t    if (currentRefinement === '') {\n\t      return null;\n\t    }\n\t    return currentRefinement;\n\t  });\n\t}\n\t\n\tfunction getValue(name, props, searchState, context) {\n\t  var currentRefinement = getCurrentRefinement(props, searchState, context);\n\t  return name === currentRefinement ?

You can AND tags by separating them by commas.\n\t*   To OR tags, you must add parentheses. For example, tags=tag1,(tag2,tag3) means tag1 AND (tag2 OR tag3).\n\t*   You can also use an array, for example tagFilters: [\"tag1\",[\"tag2\",\"tag3\"]]\n\t*   means tag1 AND (tag2 OR tag3).\n\t*   At indexing, tags should be added in the _tags** attribute\n\t*   of objects (for example {\"_tags\":[\"tag1\",\"tag2\"]}).\n\t* - facetFilters: filter the query by a list of facets.\n\t*   Facets are separated by commas and each facet is encoded as `attributeName:value`.\n\t*   For example: `facetFilters=category:Book,author:John%20Doe`.\n\t*   You can also use an array (for example `[\"category:Book\",\"author:John%20Doe\"]`).\n\t* - facets: List of object attributes that you want to use for faceting.\n\t*   Comma separated list: `\"category,author\"` or array `['category','author']`\n\t*   Only attributes that have been added in **attributesForFaceting** index setting\n\t*   can be used in this parameter.\n\t*   You can also use `*` to perform faceting on all attributes specified in **attributesForFaceting**.\n\t* - queryType: select how the query words are interpreted, it can be one of the following value:\n\t*    - prefixAll: all query words are interpreted as prefixes,\n\t*    - prefixLast: only the last word is interpreted as a prefix (default behavior),\n\t*    - prefixNone: no query word is interpreted as a prefix. This option is not recommended.\n\t* - optionalWords: a string that contains the list of words that should\n\t* be considered as optional when found in the query.\n\t*   Comma separated and array are accepted.\n\t* - distinct: If set to 1, enable the distinct feature (disabled by default)\n\t* if the attributeForDistinct index setting is set.\n\t*   This feature is similar to the SQL \"distinct\" keyword: when enabled\n\t*   in a query with the distinct=1 parameter,\n\t*   all hits containing a duplicate value for the attributeForDistinct attribute are removed from results.\n\t*   For example, if the chosen attribute is show_name and several hits have\n\t*   the same value for show_name, then only the best\n\t*   one is kept and others are removed.\n\t* - restrictSearchableAttributes: List of attributes you want to use for\n\t* textual search (must be a subset of the attributesToIndex index setting)\n\t* either comma separated or as an array\n\t* @param {function} [callback] the result callback called with two arguments:\n\t*  error: null or Error('message').

The\n\t  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n\t  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n\t  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t\n\t  Terminology\n\t  -----------\n\t\n\t  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n\t  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n\t  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n\t  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n\t  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n\t  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\t\n\t  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\t\n\t  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n\t  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n\t  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\t\n\t  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n\t  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n\t  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n\t  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n\t  itself fulfill.\n\t\n\t\n\t  Basic Usage:\n\t  ------------\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\t    // on success\n\t    resolve(value);\n\t\n\t    // on failure\n\t    reject(reason);\n\t  });\n\t\n\t  promise.then(function(value) {\n\t    // on fulfillment\n\t  }, function(reason) {\n\t    // on rejection\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  Advanced Usage:\n\t  ---------------\n\t\n\t  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n\t  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  function getJSON(url) {\n\t    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\t\n\t      xhr.open('GET', url);\n\t      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n\t      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n\t      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n\t      xhr.send();\n\t\n\t      function handler() {\n\t        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n\t          if (this.status === 200) {\n\t            resolve(this.response);\n\t          } else {\n\t            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n\t          }\n\t        }\n\t      };\n\t    });\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n\t    // on fulfillment\n\t  }, function(reason) {\n\t    // on rejection\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  Promise.all([\n\t    getJSON('/posts'),\n\t    getJSON('/comments')\n\t  ]).then(function(values){\n\t    values[0] // => postsJSON\n\t    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\t\n\t    return values;\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  @class Promise\n\t  @param {Function} resolver\n\t  Useful for tooling.\n\t  @constructor\n\t*/\n\t\n\tvar Promise$1 = function () {\n\t  function Promise(resolver) {\n\t    this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n\t    this._result = this._state = undefined;\n\t    this._subscribers = [];\n\t\n\t    if (noop !== resolver) {\n\t      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n\t      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n\t    }\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t  The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n\t  which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n\t  reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t   ```js\n\t  findUser().then(function(user){\n\t    // user is available\n\t  }, function(reason){\n\t    // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t   Chaining\n\t  --------\n\t   The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n\t  promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n\t  or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n\t   ```js\n\t  findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t    return user.name;\n\t  }, function (reason) {\n\t    return 'default name';\n\t  }).then(function (userName) {\n\t    // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n\t    // will be `'default name'`\n\t  });\n\t   findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t    throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n\t  }, function (reason) {\n\t    throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n\t  }).then(function (value) {\n\t    // never reached\n\t  }, function (reason) {\n\t    // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n\t    // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t  If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n\t   ```js\n\t  findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t    throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n\t  }).then(function (value) {\n\t    // never reached\n\t  }).then(function (value) {\n\t    // never reached\n\t  }, function (reason) {\n\t    // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t   Assimilation\n\t  ------------\n\t   Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n\t  retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n\t  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n\t  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n\t   ```js\n\t  findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n\t  }).then(function (comments) {\n\t    // The user's comments are now available\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t   If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\t   ```js\n\t  findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n\t  }).then(function (comments) {\n\t    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n\t  }, function (reason) {\n\t    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t   Simple Example\n\t  --------------\n\t   Synchronous Example\n\t   ```javascript\n\t  let result;\n\t   try {\n\t    result =

You can AND tags by separating them by commas.\n*   To OR tags, you must add parentheses. For example, tags=tag1,(tag2,tag3) means tag1 AND (tag2 OR tag3).\n*   You can also use an array, for example tagFilters: [\"tag1\",[\"tag2\",\"tag3\"]]\n*   means tag1 AND (tag2 OR tag3).\n*   At indexing, tags should be added in the _tags** attribute\n*   of objects (for example {\"_tags\":[\"tag1\",\"tag2\"]}).\n* - facetFilters: filter the query by a list of facets.\n*   Facets are separated by commas and each facet is encoded as `attributeName:value`.\n*   For example: `facetFilters=category:Book,author:John%20Doe`.\n*   You can also use an array (for example `[\"category:Book\",\"author:John%20Doe\"]`).\n* - facets: List of object attributes that you want to use for faceting.\n*   Comma separated list: `\"category,author\"` or array `['category','author']`\n*   Only attributes that have been added in **attributesForFaceting** index setting\n*   can be used in this parameter.\n*   You can also use `*` to perform faceting on all attributes specified in **attributesForFaceting**.\n* - queryType: select how the query words are interpreted, it can be one of the following value:\n*    - prefixAll: all query words are interpreted as prefixes,\n*    - prefixLast: only the last word is interpreted as a prefix (default behavior),\n*    - prefixNone: no query word is interpreted as a prefix.

The\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n  Terminology\n  -----------\n\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n  itself fulfill.\n\n\n  Basic Usage:\n  ------------\n\n  ```js\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // on success\n    resolve(value);\n\n    // on failure\n    reject(reason);\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Usage:\n  ---------------\n\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n  ```js\n  function getJSON(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n      xhr.send();\n\n      function handler() {\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n          if (this.status === 200) {\n            resolve(this.response);\n          } else {\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n          }\n        }\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n  ```js\n  Promise.all([\n    getJSON('/posts'),\n    getJSON('/comments')\n  ]).then(function(values){\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n    return values;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class Promise\n  @param {Function} resolver\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @constructor\n*/\n\nvar Promise$1 = function () {\n  function Promise(resolver) {\n    this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n    this._result = this._state = undefined;\n    this._subscribers = [];\n\n    if (noop !== resolver) {\n      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n  The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n  which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n  reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function(user){\n    // user is available\n  }, function(reason){\n    // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n  });\n  ```\n   Chaining\n  --------\n   The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n  promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n  or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return user.name;\n  }, function (reason) {\n    return 'default name';\n  }).then(function (userName) {\n    // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n    // will be `'default name'`\n  });\n   findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n  }, function (reason) {\n    throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n    // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n  });\n  ```\n  If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n  });\n  ```\n   Assimilation\n  ------------\n   Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n  retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // The user's comments are now available\n  });\n  ```\n   If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n  });\n  ```\n   Simple Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let result;\n   try {\n    result = findResult();\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n  findResult(function(result, err){\n    if (err) {\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n   Promise Example;\n   ```javascript\n  findResult().then(function(result){\n    // success\n  }, function(reason){\n    // failure\n  });\n  ```\n   Advanced Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let author, books;\n   try {\n    author = findAuthor();\n    books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback

Promise Example;\n   ```javascript\n  findAuthor().\n    then(findBooksByAuthor).\n    then(function(books){\n      // found books\n  }).catch(function(reason){\n    // something went wrong\n  });\n
